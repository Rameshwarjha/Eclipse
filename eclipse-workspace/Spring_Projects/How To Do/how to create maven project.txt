How to create maven project:
Go to File-> new-> Maven_Project->next->Select catalog as "Internal" -> select archtype quickstart maven project-> Give the name of GroupID and Artifact ID Click Next or Finish

Install Dependency inside "Dependencies" in "pom.xml"

1st dependency -> spring Core ->   <!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework/spring-core -->

2nd dependency -> Spring Context ->  <!--https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework/spring-context -->

** on saving it will install dependencies automatically from the location copied and saved in dependencies in above step 

Now create "config.xml" file and copy dependencies from previous folder demo code OR from documentation of spring from 46-47 page 

Now inside <beans> create a <bean> with complete location in class for ex- class="com.demo.springcore.Hello_world_maven_Project.Student" and also give name to the bean ex- name="stu1"
## all bean properties should be according to fields provided in the class 

## we can create multiple bean in this with same process
- Now it is instantiated inside the app.java to run it 
   example code -        ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("Config.xml");

                         Student st = (Student)context.getBean("stu1");
       			 System.out.println(st);
